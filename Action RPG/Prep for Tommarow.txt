This page is for putting my ideas and thoughts to hang on to untill tommarow.
Because we forget stuff the next day, right?

Anyways...

todo::
- HP and Invincibility for Player.
- add more than one enemy. (TOTALLY FUCKED. I HAVE NO IDEA ON HOW TO DO)
- implement tiles (i have never done this.)
